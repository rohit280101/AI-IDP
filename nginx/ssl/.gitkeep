# Placeholder for SSL certificates
# 
# For production deployment with HTTPS:
# 1. Obtain SSL certificates (e.g., from Let's Encrypt)
# 2. Place your certificate files here:
#    - cert.pem (or fullchain.pem)
#    - key.pem (or privkey.pem)
# 3. Update the paths in nginx.conf accordingly
#
# Using Let's Encrypt with Certbot:
# sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
# Then copy the certificates:
# cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem ./cert.pem
# cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem ./key.pem
